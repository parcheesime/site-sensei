Web Page Grader
Purpose: The Web Page Grader is designed to assist students in self-assessing their HTML and CSS projects before submission. This tool aims to provide immediate feedback, helping students improve and refine their web development skills.

Functionality: Utilizing packages like Beautiful Soup, the Web Page Grader evaluates the submitted web pages by:

Checking URL accessibility.
Analyzing the use and frequency of various HTML tags.
Identifying missing or unused tags.
Reviewing the usage of the class attribute throughout the document.
Verifying the status of embedded links and detecting any broken or missing links.
How It Works:

Students input the URL of their web project.
The system processes the webpage and generates a report which includes:
URL status.
Comprehensive lists of present and absent HTML tags.
Count of class attribute usages.
Status of all links on the page, highlighting any issues.
Output: The results are displayed on a user-friendly web page, allowing students to easily understand and act on the feedback provided.

Local Usage: Students can run the Web Page Grader directly on their local machines, ensuring a convenient and secure way to check their work as they develop their projects.
